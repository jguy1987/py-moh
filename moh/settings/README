Django has a method by which you can setup different environments with different settings.

For example, we have a common settings, a dev settings, and a prod settings (prod doesn't exist yet)
common.py is common to all installations and contains root level settings, like app declarations.
In general, do not change anything in common.py
dev.py contains development settings. it is a template for the prod.py

To set this up, copy dev.py to prod.py, then change settings as appropriate in prod.py.
Then, open asgi.py, manage.py and wsgi.py and change the line

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'moh.settings.dev')

to

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'moh.settings.prod')

And save. Then, reboot your web server. Now, Django will be set to your prod settings and won't
be overwritten by a main branch update.
